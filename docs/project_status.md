# Visio Stencil Catalog - Project Documentation

This document provides comprehensive information about the project, including requirements, objectives, and implementation status.

## Overview
A lightweight web application that catalogs Visio stencil files across network directories. The tool helps engineers quickly find which stencils contain specific shapes and their physical storage locations, without requiring Visio installation to operate.

## Project Objectives
1. **Replace VBA Solution**: Create a modern alternative to our existing Excel/VBA tool
2. **Zero Visio Dependency**: Operate without Visio application integration
3. **Real-Time Search**: Enable instant shape/stencil searching across directories
4. **Portability**: Deploy as single executable or Docker container

## Implementation Status

### Core Features Checklist

#### Network Directory Scanner
- [x] Recursive .vss/.vssx file detection
- [x] Manual refresh button for updated scans
- [ ] Background metadata caching

#### Shape Search Engine
- [x] Instant search across shapes (Target: 50k+ shapes)
- [ ] Partial match highlighting
- [x] Case-insensitive filtering

#### Stencil Relationship Mapping
- [x] Clear shape-to-stencil association
- [x] Physical file path visibility
- [x] Last scan timestamp display

#### Stencil Health Monitoring (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Duplicate shape detection
- [ ] Empty stencil alerts
- [ ] Version comparison

#### Export Capabilities (Nice to Have)
- [ ] CSV/Excel report generation
- [ ] Copy-paste support for paths
- [ ] Snapshot comparisons

### Technical Implementation

#### Backend
- [x] Python-based directory traversal
- [x] Stencil parsing using ZIP/XML analysis
- [ ] Lightweight SQLite caching

#### Frontend
- [x] Streamlit web interface
- [x] Three-column results layout
- [x] Search-as-you-type functionality

#### Deployment
- [ ] PyInstaller executable for Windows
- [ ] Docker image for server deployment
- [ ] Configuration via YAML file

## Success Metrics Achievement

### Performance
- [ ] <5s initial directory scan (cached)
- [ ] <200ms search response
- [ ] <100MB memory usage

### Usability
- [x] Single-click operation
- [x] Zero training required
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout

### Adoption
- [ ] Replace 100% of VBA tool usage
- [ ] Department-wide deployment
- [ ] Monthly active users >50

## Milestone Progress
1. **Phase 1**: Directory scanner + basic UI ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Search engine + caching ⚠️ (partial)
3. **Phase 3**: Deployment packaging ❌
4. **Phase 4**: User documentation ✅

## Non-Goals
The following are explicitly out of scope for this project:
- Direct Visio file editing
- Shape preview rendering
- Network permissions management
- Version control integration

## Identified Risks
- Large directory scan times
- Visio file format changes
- Network latency issues
- Permission escalation requirements

## Next Steps
Priority items for implementation:
1. Implement SQLite caching for faster performance
2. Add partial match highlighting in search results
3. Create deployment packages (PyInstaller, Docker)
4. Implement export capabilities
5. Add stencil health monitoring features
