- ✅ Partial match highlighting
- ✅ Case-insensitive filtering

### Stencil Relationship Mapping
- ✅ Clear shape-to-stencil association
- ✅ Physical file path visibility
- ✅ Last scan timestamp display
- ✅ Visual shape preview functionality

- ✅ Duplicate shape detection
- ✅ Empty stencil alerts
- ✅ Version comparison
- ✅ Large stencil detection
- ✅ Corrupt file identification
- ✅ Data visualization with charts

### Export Capabilities
- ✅ CSV/Excel report generation
- ✅ Copy-paste support for paths
- ✅ Health report exports

### External Integration
- ✅ Visio Temp File Cleaner incorporated from external repository

## Technical Implementation

### Backend
- ✅ Python-based directory traversal
- ✅ Stencil parsing using ZIP/XML analysis
- ✅ Lightweight SQLite caching
- ✅ Algorithmic shape preview generation

### Frontend
- ✅ Streamlit web interface
- ✅ Three-column results layout
- ✅ Search-as-you-type functionality
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Data visualization with matplotlib

### Deployment
- ✅ PyInstaller executable for Windows
- ✅ Docker image for server deployment
- ✅ Configuration via YAML file

## Performance Improvements

- ✅ Fast directory scanning with caching
- ✅ Background scanning threads
- ✅ Configurable auto-refresh

## Next Steps

Although we've completed all the core features, here are some recommendations for future enhancements:

1. Add user authentication for multi-user environments
2. Implement a full REST API for programmatic access
3. Add stencil preview capabilities
4. Implement advanced search using machine learning
5. Add batch operations for stencil management

## How to Use the New Features

### Shape Preview
1. Search for shapes as normal in the main search page or Stencil Health page
2. Click the "👁️ Preview" button next to any shape
3. View the visual representation of the shape
4. Use the "Close Preview" button to hide the preview

### Stencil Health Monitor
1. Navigate to the "Stencil Health" page from the sidebar
2. Enter the directory to scan and click "Analyze Health"
3. View the detected issues and export reports as needed
4. Use the new visualizations to understand issue types and severities
5. Filter issues by both severity and issue type
6. Identify potentially corrupt files and unusually large stencils

### SQLite Caching
- The application now automatically caches stencil data
- Subsequent scans will be faster as only modified files are processed
- No user action required - it works behind the scenes

### Configuration
- The application settings can now be customized in the `config.yaml` file
- Changes to the configuration take effect on application restart

### Deployment Options
- Run `python build.py --exe` to create a standalone executable
- Run `python build.py --docker` to create a Docker image
- Run `python build.py --all` to create both
