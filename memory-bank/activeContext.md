# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The Visio Stencil Search application is currently in Beta status. The primary focus is on stabilizing core functionality, improving performance, and enhancing user experience. The application has basic functionality implemented, including stencil scanning, shape searching, and temp file cleaning, but requires further refinement.

## Recent Changes
- Basic application structure implemented with three main pages
- Core functionality for scanning and parsing Visio stencils
- Implementation of shape preview without Visio dependency
- Stencil health analysis features
- Temporary file cleaning functionality

## Active Decisions
- **Storage Approach**: Using file-based storage for simplicity rather than a full database system
- **UI Framework**: Committed to Streamlit for rapid development and ease of use
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Maintaining core functionality across operating systems while acknowledging some Windows-specific features
- **No Visio Dependency**: Committed to maintaining functionality without requiring Visio installation

## Current Tasks
- Reviewing and improving error handling throughout the application
- Optimizing performance for large stencil collections
- Enhancing the user interface for better usability
- Testing with various stencil file formats and sizes
- Documenting code and features

## Next Steps
1. Improve search performance and accuracy
2. Enhance shape preview rendering quality
3. Add ability to export search results
4. Implement advanced filtering options in the search interface
5. Optimize database structure for faster queries
6. Add more detailed analytics in the Stencil Health page
7. Consider integration with version control for stencil management
8. Add user preferences for customizing the interface

## Technical Considerations
- Memory usage when scanning large network directories
- Database performance with thousands of stencils
- Preview generation speed vs. quality tradeoffs
- Cross-platform testing, especially for network path handling
- Ensuring proper error handling for network disconnections
