# Active Context: Visio Bridge Integration Suite (Updated: 2025-04-28)

## Current Work Focus
- Major UI/UX critical enhancements completed for Streamlit-based dashboard.
- Focused on persistent user preferences and interactive sidebar integration in Streamlit.
- Ensured memory bank and progress documentation accurately track feature status and workflows.

## Recent Changes

* **Critical Enhancements Plan (Phase 2/UX):**
  - Implemented a full interactive sidebar (see `modules/Visio_Stencil_Explorer.py`) allowing users to set, persist, and reset preferences such as document search, FTS, results/page, pagination, UI theme, and Visio auto-refresh directly in the Streamlit UI.
  - Preferences are persisted using the robust `UserPreferences` class in `app/core/preferences.py`, with atomic JSON file storage and fallback to defaults on error.
  - Sidebar UI applies changes live, preferences are auto-saved, and reset to defaults is available.
  - Addressed legacy errors with FTS, event loop shutdowns, and improved cross-platform behavior.

* **Streamlit User Preferences (2025-04-28):**
  - All user options for search and UI are now easily discoverable and adjustable at runtime by all users.
  - Old hardcoded session state defaults and manual JSON edits are no longer necessary.

* **Bug Fixes:**
  - Resolved SyntaxError in `app/core/db.py` and ensured robust database initialization for cache and FTS.
  - Fixed app startup and shutdown error propagation for a smoother development cycle.

## Active Decisions

* Prioritize user-facing UX and persistence improvements in Streamlit dashboard before full Next.js feature parity push.
* Continue to document all major architectural and workflow changes in the memory bank as the project evolves.

## Current Tasks

* Confirm no regressions on mainline Streamlit dashboard workflow.
* Verify persistence and reset logic for preferences file and sidebar UI in typical session scenarios.

## Next Steps (High-Level)
1. Complete remaining critical enhancements as scoped.
2. Merge these improvements into the main development branch.
3. Resume Next.js feature parity work, ensuring UX consistency and parity with Streamlit, especially around user preference management.

## Technical Considerations

* The new user preferences flow is fully decoupled and safe for further extension.
* All Streamlit widgets for preferences use unique keys and state logic.
* Preferences logic is modular and can be migrated to Next.js or other UI layers as needed.
