# Active Context (Updated 2025-06-04)

## Current Work Focus
The Visio Stencil Search application is in Beta status with all core functionality implemented. The current focus is on improving stability, performance optimization, enhancing the user interface, and refining the Visio integration features. The application successfully performs stencil scanning, full-text shape searching, temporary file cleaning, stencil health analysis, and direct Visio document integration. The codebase shows a mature implementation with robust error handling, database optimization, and a modular component architecture.

## Recent Changes
- Enhanced database integrity checking with automatic backup and recovery
- Improved error handling throughout the application, especially in Visio integration
- Added remote server connection support for Visio integration
- Enhanced shape preview rendering with better geometry parsing
- Optimized search performance with improved database indexing and FTS5 implementation
- Added shape collection feature for batch operations with Visio
- Improved UI layout with card-based design and better visual hierarchy
- Added advanced search filtering options including shape metadata filters
- Enhanced stencil health analysis with more comprehensive checks
- Added data visualization for health reports and stencil statistics
- Implemented directory preset management for quick directory switching
- Added export capabilities for search results and health reports in multiple formats
- Implemented multi-document and multi-page support in Visio Control

## Active Decisions
- **Storage Approach**: Using SQLite database with FTS5 for efficient full-text searches and proper indexing
- **UI Framework**: Committed to Streamlit with enhanced custom styling and JavaScript for responsive design
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Core functionality works across platforms, with Windows-specific features for Visio integration
- **No Visio Dependency**: Core features work without Visio, but enhanced functionality available when Visio is installed
- **UI Layout Improvements**: Using a card-based layout with consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
- **Search Optimization**: Using full-text search with toggle for compatibility and advanced filtering options
- **Component Organization**: Modular approach with reusable UI components shared across pages
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation and informative user feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Database optimization with proper indexing and caching strategies

## Current Tasks
- Refining the Visio integration with better error handling and remote connection support
- Optimizing database performance for large stencil collections
- Enhancing shape preview rendering quality
- Implementing additional export options and formats
- Testing with various stencil file formats and sizes
- Improving error recovery for corrupted database files
- Enhancing cross-platform path handling for network locations
- Implementing advanced search filtering options

## Next Steps
1. Enhance shape preview rendering quality for complex shapes
2. Add more advanced filtering options in the search interface
3. Implement batch operations for stencil management
4. Add user preferences for customizing the interface
5. Add more detailed analytics in the Stencil Health page
6. Improve cross-platform path handling for network locations
7. Add REST API for programmatic access
8. Create comprehensive user documentation
9. Implement advanced shape alignment and arrangement in Visio Control
10. Add more visualization options for stencil data

## Technical Considerations
- Memory usage optimization when scanning large network directories
- Database performance tuning for handling thousands of stencils
- Preview generation speed vs. quality tradeoffs
- Cross-platform testing, especially for network path handling
- Error handling for network disconnections and corrupt files
- Streamlit component limitations and workarounds for complex UI needs
- Full-text search integration with existing search interfaces
- Database integrity maintenance for long-term reliability
- Visio COM integration limitations and error handling
- Background processing for long-running operations
