# Active Context: Visio Bridge Integration Suite (Updated: CURRENT_DATE)

## Current Work Focus
Finalizing the core integration components based on the plan for request `req-4`. Focus is currently on verifying the end-to-end connectivity between the MCP client, MCP server, Local API server, and Visio, before proceeding to packaging.

## Recent Changes (Request req-4)

*   **Phase 1 Completed (`task-15`):** Implemented Visio COM logic for text and image import in `visio_integration.py`, including handling defaults, units, and temporary files.
*   **Phase 2 Completed (`task-16`):** Updated FastAPI CORS origins in `main.py` to allow `chrome-extension://*` for development.
*   **Phase 3 Completed (`task-17`):** Refactored Chrome Extension state (`popup.js`) to use `chrome.storage.local` for persistence.
*   **Phase 4 Completed (`task-18`):** Refined MCP server (`visio_bridge_server.py`) configuration (configurable timeout, added command-line args for URL/API Key).
*   **Phase 5 In Progress (`task-19`):** Successfully started background processes for `local-api-server` and `mcp-server` after resolving dependency and command execution issues. Created `manual_verification_phase5.md` outlining steps for manual end-to-end testing using an MCP client.

## Active Decisions

*   **MCP Server Config:** Confirmed using command-line arguments (`--url`, `--api-key`, `--timeout`) for MCP server configuration is more reliable than environment variables when launching via `run_terminal_cmd`.
*   **Task Order:** Proceeding with dependency-based task order for request `req-4`.
*   **Phase 5 Verification:** Manual verification using an MCP client is necessary due to limitations in automated testing of the full stack via available tools.

## Current Tasks

*   **Pending Manual Verification:** User needs to perform the steps in `manual_verification_phase5.md` to confirm end-to-end functionality (MCP Client -> MCP Server -> Local API -> Visio).

## Next Steps (High-Level)

1.  **Approve Phase 5 (`task-19`)**: User to approve after successful manual verification.
2.  **Execute Phase 6 (`task-20`)**: Begin packaging the `local-api-server` using PyInstaller, addressing any `pywin32` bundling issues.
3.  Complete any remaining tasks from the original plan (`req-4`).

## Technical Considerations

*   Reliability of starting/configuring background processes via `run_terminal_cmd` needs careful syntax (using `venv` python, correct paths, command-line args preferred over env vars set in the same command string).
*   The difference in network resolution (`getaddrinfo`) between direct script execution and execution triggered via MCP tool calls needs further investigation if manual tests also fail.
*   PyInstaller packaging for applications using `pywin32` often requires specific hooks or hidden import configurations.
