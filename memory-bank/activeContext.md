# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The Visio Stencil Search application is currently in Beta status. The primary focus is on stabilizing core functionality, improving performance, and enhancing user experience through UI layout improvements. The application has basic functionality implemented, including stencil scanning, shape searching, and temp file cleaning, but requires further refinement, particularly in the user interface.

## Recent Changes
- Basic application structure implemented with three main pages
- Core functionality for scanning and parsing Visio stencils
- Implementation of shape preview without Visio dependency
- Stencil health analysis features
- Temporary file cleaning functionality
- Initial UI implementation with basic layout
- Implemented full-text search capability for improved search performance
- Added search options UI with toggle between FTS and standard search
- Optimized database structure with additional indexes
- Added search performance benchmark tools

## Active Decisions
- **Storage Approach**: Using file-based storage for simplicity rather than a full database system
- **UI Framework**: Committed to Streamlit for rapid development and ease of use
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Maintaining core functionality across operating systems while acknowledging some Windows-specific features
- **No Visio Dependency**: Committed to maintaining functionality without requiring Visio installation
- **UI Layout Improvements**: Restructuring the UI for better usability, visual hierarchy, and space utilization
- **Search Performance**: Implementing full-text search for faster and more accurate results

## Current Tasks
- Reviewing and improving error handling throughout the application
- Optimizing performance for large stencil collections
- Enhancing the user interface for better usability
- Implementing UI layout improvements including:
  - Consolidating duplicate sidebar elements
  - Improving search interface with better aligned components
  - Adding data visualization to enhance empty space utilization
  - Implementing proper information messages for user guidance
  - Streamlining Visio integration with toggle controls
- Testing with various stencil file formats and sizes
- Documenting code and features

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Improve search performance and accuracy (implemented with full-text search)
2. Enhance shape preview rendering quality
3. Add ability to export search results
4. Implement advanced filtering options in the search interface
5. ✅ Optimize database structure for faster queries (implemented with improved indexes)
6. Add more detailed analytics in the Stencil Health page
7. Consider integration with version control for stencil management
8. Add user preferences for customizing the interface
9. Complete UI layout improvements:
   - Replace current filter controls with more intuitive expanders
   - Add clear visual hierarchy to search results
   - Implement data visualization for stencil statistics
   - Consolidate directory selection controls

## Technical Considerations
- Memory usage when scanning large network directories
- Database performance with thousands of stencils
- Preview generation speed vs. quality tradeoffs
- Cross-platform testing, especially for network path handling
- Ensuring proper error handling for network disconnections
- Streamlit component limitations and workarounds for complex UI needs 
- Full-text search integration with existing search interfaces
