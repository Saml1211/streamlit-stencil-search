## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
1. 📋 Advanced filtering options in the search interface
2. 📋 Improved shape preview rendering quality
3. 📋 Better error handling for network disconnections
4. 📋 Additional search result sorting options
5. 📋 More comprehensive documentation

### Medium Priority
1. 📋 User preferences for customizing the interface
2. 📋 More detailed analytics in the Stencil Health page
3. 📋 Integration with version control for stencil management
4. 📋 Better progress indicators for long operations
5. 📋 Performance optimizations for the database

### Low Priority / Future Features
1. 📋 User authentication for multi-user environments
2. 📋 REST API for programmatic access
3. 📋 Advanced search using machine learning
4. 📋 Batch operations for stencil management
5. 📋 Automated stencil organization and cleanup tools

## Known Issues

### Performance Issues
- 🐞 Scanning very large directories (10,000+ stencils) can be memory-intensive
- 🐞 Preview generation can be slow for complex shapes
- 🐞 UI responsiveness decreases during background scanning

### Cross-Platform Issues
- 🐞 Some network path handling inconsistencies between Windows and Unix systems
- 🐞 Windows-specific features may not work on other platforms

### User Interface Issues
- 🐞 Some UI elements not scaling properly on very small screens
- 🐞 Search results pagination could be improved
- 🐞 Occasional UI flickering during search
- 🐞 Duplicate sidebar elements causing confusion and wasting space
- 🐞 Poor visual hierarchy in the main area lacks clear organization
- 🐞 Empty/placeholder sections create an unfinished appearance
- 🐞 Disconnected UI elements creating confusion (e.g., search button under Shape Collection)
- 🐞 Inefficient space usage in main content area
- 🐞 Visio connection UI lacks clear status indicators

### Technical Issues
- 🐞 Occasional database locking with concurrent operations
- 🐞 Some corrupt stencils may cause the parser to hang
- 🐞 Need better error handling for malformed Visio files

## Success Metrics
- The application can successfully scan and index thousands of stencils
- Search operations return results in under 1 second
- Shape previews are generated without requiring Visio
- Temp file cleaning successfully identifies and removes problematic files
- Stencil health analysis provides actionable insights
- User interface is intuitive and efficient with clear visual hierarchy
