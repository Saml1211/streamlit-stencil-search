## Known Issues

### Performance Issues
- 🐞 Scanning very large directories (10,000+ stencils) can be memory-intensive
- 🐞 Preview generation can be slow for complex shapes
- 🐞 UI responsiveness decreases during background scanning
- 🐞 Database operations may temporarily lock during large batch operations
- 🐞 FTS rebuilding can take significant time for large collections

### Cross-Platform Issues
- 🐞 Some network path handling inconsistencies between Windows and Unix systems
- 🐞 Windows-specific Visio integration features don't work on other platforms
- 🐞 File path normalization can be inconsistent across platforms
- 🐞 Remote server connections require additional configuration and may be unstable

### User Interface Issues
- 🐞 Some UI elements not scaling properly on very small screens
- 🐞 Search results pagination could be improved
- 🐞 Occasional UI flickering during search operations
- 🐞 Complex filters can sometimes reset unexpectedly
- 🐞 Visio connection status indicators could be clearer
- 🐞 Modal dialogs for previews can sometimes have positioning issues

### Technical Issues
- 🐞 Occasional database locking with concurrent operations
- 🐞 Some corrupt stencils may cause the parser to hang
