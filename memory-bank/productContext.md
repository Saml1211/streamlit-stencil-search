# Product Context

## Purpose
The Visio Stencil Search application addresses a critical need in environments where Microsoft Visio is used extensively for technical diagrams and designs. It solves the challenge of locating specific shapes across potentially thousands of stencil files stored across various network locations, while also providing the option to directly interact with Visio when available.

## Problems Solved
1. **Stencil Discovery**: Engineers often struggle to locate the correct stencil for a specific shape, wasting valuable time searching through multiple folders and files.
2. **No Visio Requirement**: Previous solutions required having Visio installed, limiting who could search for stencils and where the search tool could be deployed.
3. **Network Resource Management**: Without a centralized way to find stencils, organizations often have duplicate stencils in multiple locations or outdated versions in use.
4. **Temporary File Issues**: Visio creates temporary files that can become corrupted, causing errors in Visio. This tool helps identify and clean those problematic files.
5. **Stencil Health**: Without proper monitoring, stencil collections can develop various issues such as empty stencils, duplicates, or corrupted files that affect diagram creation.
6. **Workflow Integration**: Engineers previously had to switch contexts between searching for shapes and using them in diagrams. The direct Visio integration bridges this gap.
7. **Favorites Management**: Users need to quickly access frequently used stencils without searching repeatedly, now possible with the favorites system.
8. **Performance Challenges**: Searching through thousands of stencils can be slow without proper indexing and optimization, addressed through database optimization.
9. **Shape Preview Limitations**: Unable to see shape previews without opening Visio, now solved with built-in preview capability.
10. **Cross-Platform Access**: Different team members may use different operating systems, requiring a solution that works across platforms.
11. **Remote Visio Integration**: Teams working in distributed environments need to connect to remote Visio instances.
12. **Batch Operations**: Engineers often need to work with multiple shapes at once, now supported through shape collection functionality.

## User Workflow
1. User opens the application in a web browser
2. Sets the directory path(s) to scan for stencil files or selects from saved presets
3. Updates the database to catalog all available stencils
4. Searches for specific shapes by name, with options for full-text or standard search
5. Views search results showing the shape name, stencil name, and location
6. Previews shapes directly in the browser without requiring Visio
7. Optionally adds frequently used stencils to favorites for quick access
8. Collects shapes for batch operations if needed
9. If Visio is available, can search within current documents or import shapes directly
10. Optionally uses additional tools for temp file cleanup or stencil health analysis
11. Can export search results or health reports in various formats
12. Can connect to remote Visio instances for teams in distributed environments
13. Performs shape editing and manipulation directly in Visio through the integrated control interface
14. Analyzes stencil health to identify and resolve issues in the stencil collection

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: Provide a clean, intuitive interface that requires minimal training
2. **Speed**: Deliver fast search results even with large stencil collections
3. **Visibility**: Show clear previews of shapes to confirm they are the ones needed
4. **Accessibility**: Make stencil information available to all relevant team members
5. **Integration**: Fit seamlessly into existing engineering workflows with direct Visio integration
6. **Maintenance**: Help maintain the health of stencil collections through analysis and cleanup tools
7. **Flexibility**: Support different search methods and filtering options to accommodate various needs
8. **Consistency**: Provide a uniform interface across all application components
9. **Efficiency**: Minimize the steps needed to find and use shapes in diagrams
10. **Responsiveness**: Ensure the interface remains snappy even with large databases
11. **Cross-Platform**: Provide consistent functionality across different operating systems
12. **Resilience**: Handle errors gracefully and recover from failures automatically
13. **Progressive Disclosure**: Surface commonly needed features while hiding advanced options until needed
14. **Visual Organization**: Group related functionality with a clear visual hierarchy
15. **Feedback**: Provide clear feedback during long-running operations

## Product Value Proposition
The Visio Stencil Search application significantly reduces time spent searching for shape resources, eliminates the need for Visio licenses just for search purposes, and helps maintain a healthy stencil collection. With direct Visio integration for users who have Visio installed, it creates a seamless workflow from finding shapes to using them in diagrams. This comprehensive approach to stencil management ultimately improves productivity for engineering and design teams that rely on Visio diagrams. The application provides value to organizations of all sizes that use Visio, from small teams with a handful of stencil files to large enterprises with thousands of stencils distributed across network locations.
