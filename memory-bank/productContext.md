# Product Context

## Purpose
The Visio Stencil Search application addresses a critical need in environments where Microsoft Visio is used extensively for technical diagrams and designs. It solves the challenge of locating specific shapes across potentially thousands of stencil files stored across various network locations.

## Problems Solved
1. **Stencil Discovery**: Engineers often struggle to locate the correct stencil for a specific shape, wasting valuable time searching through multiple folders and files.
2. **No Visio Requirement**: Previous solutions required having Visio installed, limiting who could search for stencils and where the search tool could be deployed.
3. **Network Resource Management**: Without a centralized way to find stencils, organizations often have duplicate stencils in multiple locations or outdated versions in use.
4. **Temporary File Issues**: Visio creates temporary files that can become corrupted, causing errors in Visio. This tool helps identify and clean those problematic files.
5. **Stencil Health**: Without proper monitoring, stencil collections can develop various issues such as empty stencils, duplicates, or corrupted files that affect diagram creation.

## User Workflow
1. User opens the application in a web browser
2. Sets the directory path(s) to scan for stencil files
3. Updates the database to catalog all available stencils
4. Searches for specific shapes by name
5. Views search results showing the stencil name and location
6. Previews shapes directly in the browser
7. Optionally uses additional tools for temp file cleanup or stencil health analysis

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: Provide a clean, intuitive interface that requires minimal training
2. **Speed**: Deliver fast search results even with large stencil collections
3. **Visibility**: Show clear previews of shapes to confirm they are the ones needed
4. **Accessibility**: Make stencil information available to all relevant team members
5. **Integration**: Fit seamlessly into existing engineering workflows
6. **Maintenance**: Help maintain the health of stencil collections through analysis and cleanup tools

## Product Value Proposition
The Visio Stencil Search application significantly reduces time spent searching for shape resources, eliminates the need for Visio licenses just for search purposes, and helps maintain a healthy stencil collectionâ€”ultimately improving productivity for engineering and design teams that rely on Visio diagrams.
