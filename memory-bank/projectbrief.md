# Project Brief: Visio Stencil Search

## Project Overview
Visio Stencil Search is a comprehensive application designed to catalog, search, and interact with Microsoft Visio stencil files across a network. The tool helps engineers quickly find which stencils contain specific shapes and their physical storage locations, without requiring Visio installation to operate. For users with Visio installed, the application also offers direct integration for a seamless workflow.

## Core Objectives
- Create a user-friendly interface for searching Visio stencil files
- Enable network directory scanning to locate all available stencils
- Implement real-time shape search capabilities with full-text search
- Provide shape previews without requiring Visio installation
- Include utilities for managing and cleaning problematic Visio temporary files
- Monitor stencil health and identify potential issues
- Offer direct Visio integration for enhanced workflow
- Support favorites and shape collections for improved productivity

## Key Features
- Network Directory Scanning: Recursively find Visio files (.vss, .vssx, .vssm)
- Real-time Shape Search: Instantly search across thousands of shapes
- Full-text Search: Optimized high-performance searching with FTS5
- Zero Visio Dependencies: Core features work without Visio installation
- Optional Visio Integration: Direct search and import when Visio is available
- Clear Results Display: Shows shape name, stencil name, and file path
- Shape Preview: Visualize shapes directly in the application
- Temp File Cleaner: Find and remove corrupted Visio temporary files
- Advanced Stencil Health Monitor: Analyze stencils for issues with data visualization
- Directory Presets: Save and quickly switch between common directories
- Favorites System: Mark and quickly access frequently used stencils
- Shape Collection: Gather shapes for batch operations
- Export Capabilities: Save search results in various formats (CSV, Excel, TXT)
- Database Optimization: Fast search performance with proper indexing
- Custom UI: Enhanced visual design with clear organization
- Remote Visio Connectivity: Connect to Visio instances on remote servers
- Multi-document Support: Work with multiple Visio documents simultaneously
- Cross-platform Compatibility: Core functionality works across operating systems
- Database Integrity: Automatic checking and repair of database issues
- Advanced Filtering: Filter search results by metadata and properties
- Shape Editing: Direct manipulation of shapes in Visio from the application
- Comprehensive Logging: Detailed logging for troubleshooting and analysis
- Responsive Design: UI adapts to different screen sizes

## Target Users
- Engineers and designers who work with Visio stencils
- IT administrators managing network-stored Visio resources
- Technical documentation teams
- Project managers who need to find and use specific shapes
- Organizations with large stencil collections
- Cross-functional teams with mixed operating system environments
- Distributed teams needing remote access to Visio resources

## Project Status
The application is in Beta status, with all core functionality implemented and working. It demonstrates robust error handling, performance optimization, and a mature architecture. The application is ready for use in production environments with ongoing refinements for enhancing stability, performance, and user experience. Current focus is on optimizing performance for large stencil collections, enhancing shape preview quality, and improving Visio integration.

## Success Criteria
- Accurate identification and cataloging of all stencil files in specified directories
- Fast search response times even with large stencil collections (under 1 second)
- Reliable shape previews without Visio dependencies
- Effective identification and cleanup of problematic temporary files
- Comprehensive health analysis of stencil collections with actionable insights
- Seamless integration with Visio for enhanced workflow
- Intuitive user interface requiring minimal training
- Efficient performance with large stencil collections 
- Cross-platform functionality for core features
- Resilient error handling and recovery
- Consistent data integrity across sessions
