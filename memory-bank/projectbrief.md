# Project Brief: Visio Stencil Search

## Project Overview
Visio Stencil Search is a lightweight application designed to catalog and search Microsoft Visio stencil files across a network. The tool helps engineers quickly find which stencils contain specific shapes and their physical storage locations, without requiring Visio installation to operate.

## Core Objectives
- Create a user-friendly interface for searching Visio stencil files
- Enable network directory scanning to locate all available stencils
- Implement real-time shape search capabilities
- Provide shape previews without requiring Visio installation
- Include utilities for managing and cleaning problematic Visio temporary files
- Monitor stencil health and identify potential issues

## Key Features
- Network Directory Scanning: Recursively find Visio files (.vss, .vssx, .vssm)
- Real-time Shape Search: Instantly search across thousands of shapes
- Zero Visio Dependencies: Works without Visio installation
- Clear Results Display: Shows shape name, stencil name, and file path
- Shape Preview: Visualize shapes directly in the application
- Temp File Cleaner: Find and remove corrupted Visio temporary files
- Advanced Stencil Health Monitor: Analyze stencils for issues with data visualization

## Target Users
- Engineers and designers who work with Visio stencils
- IT administrators managing network-stored Visio resources
- Technical documentation teams

## Project Status
Currently in Beta status, with core functionality implemented but potentially requiring refinement and additional features.

## Success Criteria
- Accurate identification and cataloging of all stencil files in specified directories
- Fast search response times even with large stencil collections
- Reliable shape previews without Visio dependencies
- Effective identification and cleanup of problematic temporary files
- Comprehensive health analysis of stencil collections
